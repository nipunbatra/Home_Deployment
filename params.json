We deployed a total of 33 sensors measuring the following different parameters:\r\n\r\n1. Electricity\r\n   * Household level (using Schnieder Electric EM6400 smart meter)\r\n   * MCB level (using custom microcontroller based CT platform)\r\n   * Appliance level (using jPlug, developed by Radio Studio, India)\r\n2. Water\r\n   * At inlet from utility and outlet from water tank (using Pulse based water meters)\r\n3. Ambient parameters\r\n   * Motion (using Express Controls HSM100)\r\n   * Light, temperature (using Express Controls HSM100 and FunF journal on Android phones)\r\n4. Connectivity and Network (using Android, soft sensor streams)\r\n5. Weather (using 3 weather monitoring stations providing data via REST APIs)\r\n\r\n### Repository Structure\r\n\r\nThis repository is divided as follows:\r\n\r\n* Configuration\r\n   * Database schemas: Schemas for MySQL databases used in the deployment\r\n   * Misc: Miscellaneous mappings between sensor id and locaiton in home\r\n* Dataset\r\n   * Annotated dataset: Contains *fully* labeled dataset from our deployment\r\n   * Metadata: Contains pertinent metadata for different appliances in the home and different water fixtures\r\n* How To: Misc. how to guides which are not specific to the deployment, but used in our case\r\n* Software:\r\n   * Common: Software common to SBCs and Server\r\n   * Sensors_SBC: Software used by different sensors/SBCs to get data from sensors\r\n   * Server: Software used for server management\r\n   * Startup scripts: Various startup scripts used for uninterrupted data collection (even after power outage)\r\n   * Installation: How to prepare the various computational systems for deployment\r\n   * Stats: Scripts and their outputs used for the plots used in the paper\r\n* Deployment notes\r\n\r\nOne can also find the various issues and how we resolved them.\r\n\r\n1. [Open Issues](https://github.com/nipunreddevil/Home_Deployment/issues?state=open)\r\n2. [Closed Issues](https://github.com/nipunreddevil/Home_Deployment/issues?page=1&state=closed)\r\n\r\n### Dataset\r\n\r\n1. The detailed metadata dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/nipunreddevil/Home_Deployment/wiki/Appliance-Metadata).\r\n2. The UTC timestamped annotated dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/nipunreddevil/Home_Deployment/tree/master/dataset). The event sequence for the same and more information about the same can be found on the same page.\r\n\r\nThe figure below shows the utlity of multi-modal time synchronized annotations, from one of the days during our deployment.\r\n![alt text](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75845627/Deployment/label_annotated.png \"Multi-modal annotated data\")\r\n","google":"<script>   (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){   (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),   m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)   })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');    ga('create', 'UA-43056332-1', 'nipunreddevil.github.io');   ga('send', 'pageview');  </script>","note":"Don't delete this file!
