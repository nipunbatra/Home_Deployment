1. Router seems to have gone crazy. Not giving proper names to different hardware.
-Added as an issue currently.
2. Tested from hostel room if data is getting collected on the server. Unfortunately, 
for both smart meter and jPlug there was no data since a long time. RPi which was 
attached to the Smart Meter had lose Power, whereas jPlug is unresolved. 
-Need to buy Belkin extension cables asap.
+Providing SSH access was helpful in finding which system is working,
else coming to the lab and testing might have resulted in more data loss

This makes a stronger case of also using SMS based notifications and alerts in order
to be independent of frequent internet losses. Also, exception handling was added.
